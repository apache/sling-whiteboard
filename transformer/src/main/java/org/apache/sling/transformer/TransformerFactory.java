/**
 * The <code>TransformerFactory</code> is a service which creates
 * {@link Transformer}s on demand. The created transformers form
 * the middle part of the rewriter pipeline.
 *
 * The factories itself are not chained but the resulting transformers
 * are. On each pipeline call new instances are created.
 *
 * The factory is referenced using a service property named
 * 'pipeline.type'. Each factory should have a unique value
 * for this property.
 *
 * With the optional property 'pipeline.mode' set to the value
 * 'global' the transformer is used for each and every pipeline regardless
 * of the actual configuration for this pipeline.
 * All available global transformers with a service ranking below
 * zero are chained right after the generator. All available global
 * transformers with a service ranking higher or equal to zero are
 * chained right before the serializer. Therefore the property
 * "service.ranking" should be used for the factory in combination
 * with 'pipeline.mode'.
 * To be compatible with possible future uses of the 'pipeline.mode'
 * property, it should only be used with the value 'global'.
