/**
 * Provides access to a primary key for encryption as well as supporting

 * key and taking the existing primary key and making it a secondary. The
 * secondary key should be provided until such a time that these key(s) are no
 * longer needed and/or that all prior uses of that key has been re-encrypted
 * with the new primary key.
 * 
 * Each KeyProvider is responsible for maininting an associated list of ID's for
 * the contained keys. ID's should be unique for each key and consist of a
 * byte[] of a consistent length
 * 
 * Examples implementations of a KeyProvider would provide access:
 * <ul>
 * <li>java keystore
 * <li>osgi based configuration
 * <li>third party key vaults
