fake-content-generator
------

NodeJS code that generates content in the Sling content loader format.

Currently used for my work-in-progress GraphQL example.

The tool generates a number of files in the `output` folder, see `index.js` for more info.

It is easy to modify to generate different "shapes" of textual content.
