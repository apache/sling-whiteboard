    <description>
        This archetype is creating a full Sling Project composed of
        a OSGi Bundle and a Content Package which can be deployed
        to the Sling using specific profiles. It also contains two shadow
        folders that provide example code / files which are not part
        of the default build but can be easily copied into the active modules.

        If the project was created with the **optionAll** property set
        to **y** (yes) then an **All** package is created with acts as
        the single deployment unit of all bundles and packages in that
        project.
        Otherwise the **ui.apps** package is the deployment unit.
